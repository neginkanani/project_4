<h1> PROJECT 4 PROPOSAL<br>
Maximizing Airbnb Returns through Machine Learning Analysis</h1>
<br>

## 1. Introduction

The growth of the shared economy has seen platforms like Airbnb become increasingly popular. To fully leverage this trend, there is a need to understand the key factors that make an Airbnb listing successful. This project aims to analyze Airbnb listing data from four major cities - Los Angeles, Nashville, New York, and Seattle - to identify principal components (such as size, amenities, etc.) that maximize the return for potential Airbnb hosts.

## 2. Objective

The primary objective of this project is to utilize machine learning to predict the most profitable attributes for a new Airbnb listing in each of the four cities. The profitability will be calculated as the rate of occupancy multiplied by the price of the listing. 

## 3. Methodology

The project will make use of a combination of unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques:

### 3.1 Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Clustering

The initial phase will involve an exploratory data analysis to identify the main features in the dataset. Subsequently, PCA will be utilized to reduce dimensionality and identify the key features that contribute to the profitability of an Airbnb listing. Clustering algorithms, such as K-means, could also be used to segment listings into different groups based on their characteristics and profitability.

### 3.2 Supervised Machine Learning and/or Deep Learning

Based on the principal components and clusters identified, we will then use supervised machine learning models to predict occupancy and price. Deep Learning models, particularly neural networks, may also be explored for their ability to capture complex patterns and interactions in the data that might be missed by traditional machine learning models.

## 4. Expected Outcomes

By the end of this project, we expect to have a set of actionable insights that potential Airbnb hosts can use to maximize their returns. We will provide specific advice for each of the four cities, enabling hosts to make data-driven decisions on factors such as the size of the property, amenities provided, and pricing strategy. 

## 5. Timeline

The projected timeline for this project is as follows:

- **Day 1 (Mon May 15)**: Data collection and cleaning
- **Day 2 (Wed May 17)**: Exploratory Data Analysis, PCA, and Clustering
- **Day 3 (Thu May 18)**: Building and tuning Machine Learning models
- **Day 4 (Mon May 22)**: Analysis of results 
- **Day 5 (Wed May 24)**: Report writing and presentation preparation
- **Day 6 (Thu May 25)**: Presentation delivery


## 6. Conclusion

This project provides an opportunity to apply and further develop our data science skills while providing real-world, actionable insights. By using machine learning to analyze Airbnb data, we will be able to provide valuable advice to potential hosts on how to maximize their return on investment.
